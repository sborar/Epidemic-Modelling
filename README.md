## Developers
Sheetal Borar

## Libraries used
Networkx

## Tasks
1. Basic implementation the SI(suspected, infected) spreading model using the temporal air traffic data.
2. Evaluate the effect of infection probability p on spreading speed.
3. Effect of seed node selection on spreading speed.
4. Evaluate how different centrality measure correlate with a good hiding place.
5. Evaluate different immunizations strategies based on centrality measures, random immunization and pick-a-neighbour strategy.
6. Evaluate what is a good predictor to find important disease spreading links.
