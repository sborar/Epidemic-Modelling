## Tasks
1. Basic implementation the SI(suspected, infected) spreading model using the temporal air traffic data.<\br>
2. Evaluate the effect of infection probability p on spreading speed.<\br>
3. Effect of seed node selection on spreading speed.<\br>
4. Evaluate how different centrality measure correlate with a good hiding place.<\br>
5. Evaluate different immunizations strategies based on centrality measures, random immunization and pick-a-neighbour strategy.<\br>
6. Evaluate what is a good predictor to find important disease spreading links.<\br>
